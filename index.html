        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, my name is Blanca Chacon and I am a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently a Pre-Business undergraduate student and plan on transferring to the School of Business after my second year. I'm still deciding on which concentration to choose, but I am leaning towards marketing. Additionally, I am interested in minoring in psychology. Outside of school, I enjoy exercising daily and hanging out with friends. I like to go on hikes and binge watch Netflix shows during the weekends. My favorite foods are Al Pastor tacos and Chicken Fetucci Alfredo pasta. <br><br>

       I grew up in Los Angeles, California where I recently graduated high school. I am the oldest in my family, so being a role model to my family members is very important to me. During high school, I enjoyed being active and involved in my community. I knew that being involved would help me grow as a person and help me gain the skills necessary to be a leader. The skills I learned were developed as I was a part of my schoolâ€™s ASB, student government, National Honor Society, and Cross-Country Team. Through these experiences, I was able to learn how to speak professionally, work effectively with others, understand othersâ€™ points of view, and be persistent. Over the summer I took a step further to keep myself busy by applying for an internship at the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation headquarters. I was able to work as an intern and have the experience of working in a professional workspace, meanwhile working as an assistant in the Travel Department. After completing this internship I gained the skills of time management and multitasking that useful while in college. Giving back to my community was very signifcantI to me, so I dedicated most of my free time in high school volunteering at a local hospital and recreational park.<br><br>

        When I started college I knew that I had to continue to learn and improve my strengths and weaknesses. I am a very motivated and determined student, so I try to get involved in clubs at school to boost my self-esteem as a student and keep working on reaching my fullest potential. I am currently involved in the First-Generation Student Association where I am able to express any concerns I feel in return for useful advice and tips. I am able to connect with other students who also go through similar challenges as a first-generation student. Midway through the year, board member applications opened and I applied for the position as Communications Chair. I received the position and since then, have been helping organize virtual events and meetings. 
        
        
As for my future years, I hope to accomplish small goals I have set for myself. I want to continue to be a part of small communities in college and plan to do so by joining the Latino Student Business Association and Mujeres Unidas. These small steps are part of networking and advertising yourself which I have learned is a vital tool needed to get introduced to many opportunities.
